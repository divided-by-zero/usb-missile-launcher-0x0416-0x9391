Introduction
=============

This is a linux kernel module for the usb missile launcher idVendor: 0x0416 idProduct: 0x9391.
It makes use of the /sys/ pseudo-filesystem for user interaction. So you could easily write an user
program in many programming languages to control the device. An example shell-script, how to control the device
is given with this tarball(mc.sh). Also there is hot-plugging support via some udev rules(look into the installation chapter, how to set it up properly).

Installing missile_launcher on GNU/Linux Systems
================================================

Dependencies: Linux kernel headers!

1) Unzip the missile_launcher-1.0 tarball.
    ->  tar -xvf missile_launcher-1.0.tar

2) Install the linux kernel headers. 
    -> uname -a to see which headers you need.
        -> on ubuntu/mint try something like: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-*-*
            (replacing the "*" with your right version gathered via uname -a)

3) Lookup the path where your kernel header files have been installed.
    -> on my system it is: /usr/src/linux-headers-3.0.0-12-generic/

4) Change directory into misslile_launcher-1.0/
    -> make KDIR=/your/path/to/headers/
        -> you should now have a missile_launcher.ko file in your directory!

5) Get hot-plugging support working!
    -> edit the 10-usb.rules file. 
       You need to replace the /your/path/to/missile_launcher.ko path with the real path to the .ko file.
        -> now: sudo cp missile_launcher.ko /etc/udev/rules.d/
            -> Plug-in your device and check via: "lsmod | grep missile_launcher" if it has been loaded.
            If the module didn't load up try to load it manually via: sudo insmod missile_launcher.ko.

6) Start mc.sh (./mc.sh) and check if all works properly.
